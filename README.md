## App Features

The project uses Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL on the backend and React for the frontend. The App uses the OpenTok API to create unique session IDs, or in our case 'bars', that are available for others to join via the bar's name (either chosen or randomly generated) and password. Upon a successful log in, the user is granted a token that is used to join the session. Once you've created a bar and invited some friends to join, you can play games and hang out through video chat!
